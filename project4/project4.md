Final Project
Objectives
Gain experience with designing and implementing a web application with Python and JavaScript.
Overview
The final project is your opportunity to design and implement a dynamic website of your own. So long as your final project draws upon this course’s lessons, the nature of your website will be entirely up to you, albeit subject to the staff’s approval.

Requirements
In this project, you are asked to build a web application of your own. The nature of the application is up to you, subject to a few requirements:

Your web application must utilize at least two of Python, JavaScript, and SQL.
Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file you created or modified, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
If you’ve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to requirements.txt!
Beyond these requirements, the design, look, and feel of the website are up to you!
